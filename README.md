# Airline Delay Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive dashboard built to visualize and analyze flight delay data, identifying patterns and causes of delays in various categories such as security, weather, carrier, and NAS delays. The dashboard provides an overview of total flights, cancellations, carriers, airports, and delays, offering insights into the most affected routes, airports, and times.

## Dataset

The data used in this dashboard tracks various factors that contribute to airline delays. It includes metrics on:
- **Total Flights**
- **Cancelled Flights**
- **Total Carriers**
- **Origin and Destination Airports**
- **Delay Causes** (Security, Weather, Carrier, NAS)

The purpose of the dataset is to help analyze delay patterns and potentially find trends to mitigate delay causes. Common categories of delays include:
- **Security Delay**: Delays due to security issues.
- **NAS Delay**: Delays due to the National Aviation System.
- **Carrier Delay**: Delays caused by the airline carrier.
- **Weather Delay**: Delays caused by weather conditions.

The dataset can be accessed here: [Flight Delay and Causes on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undersc0re/flight-delay-and-causes).

## Data Visualization and Metrics

The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

1. **Overview**: Displays general statistics, such as total flights, cancellations, carriers, and airports, with filters for month, day, country, airport, and airline.
2. **Airport Analysis**: Provides insights into the top airports by number of flights, departure delays, and distances covered. It also ranks airlines by on-time departures.
3. **Delay Details**: Delivers an in-depth look into the average delays by category (e.g., security, carrier) and tracks delay trends by month and day.

## Key Visualizations
- **Total Flights by Month**: Line chart showing total flights over the months.
- **Cancelled Flights by Month**: Bar chart of cancellations by month.
- **Average Delay Metrics**: Visualizes average arrival, departure, and carrier delays.
- **Top Airports by Flights and Delays**: Highlights top airports with the most flights and the highest delay metrics.
- **Delay Causes**: Pie chart showing the distribution of delay causes by country.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following components:

- **Data Preparation**: Scripts or Jupyter notebooks to preprocess and clean the data for dashboard visualization.
- **Dashboard Development**: Code and files for creating the dashboard visuals, including:
  - Filters and drill-downs for customized views.
  - Charts and KPIs for various delay metrics.
  - Layout customization to ensure user-friendly navigation across Overview, Airport, and Delay Details sections.
